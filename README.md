Abstract – Facial recognition technology is a useful tool for addressing the issue of missing persons, especially those who have been victimized by criminal activities such as human trafficking, slavery, and child labor. The proposed research initiative aims to leverage this technology to locate missing persons and prevent further victimization. The initiative proposes an Android application that allows the public to submit information and photos of missing individuals to a centralized database that can be accessed by law enforcement officials. The facial recognition algorithm used in the tool must be highly accurate to ensure that missing persons are located as quickly as possible and prevent any false matches that could delay the search process. A desktop software developed for police stations is another crucial component of the proposed tool that allows law enforcement officials to perform facial recognition searches on the database and add new cases if an unknown face appears. The software must be user-friendly and highly secure, as it would contain sensitive information about missing persons and could potentially be accessed by unauthorized individuals. While the proposed tool has the potential to improve the search process for missing persons and combat criminal activities, such as human trafficking and slavery, potential risks associated with the use of facial recognition technology, such as false matches and privacy concerns, must be considered and addressed to ensure ethical and responsible use.
